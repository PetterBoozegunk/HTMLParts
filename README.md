HTMLParts
=========

A small HTML prototype tool written in <a href="http://nodejs.org/">nodejs</a>

Check <a href="https://github.com/PetterBoozegunk/HTMLParts/blob/master/index.html">index.html</a> for an example of what to do with HTMLParts.

The basic idea was to make it possible to include files (like in PHP etc) 
when building small, hardcoded HTML prototypes.
